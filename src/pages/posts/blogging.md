This blog was made using Panini, a super simple flat file generator, Markdown, Handlebars and Gulp. The design is done with [Foundation for sites](http://foundation.zurb.com).

## My blog's setup
Basically I just wanted to do some advanced stuff with flat file generation and also wanted to have a place to write occasionally about things I am doing. n general this blog will be mostly about stuff I develop and general thoughts I have.
